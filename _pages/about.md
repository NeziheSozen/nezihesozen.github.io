>   I am a graphics programmer. I mostly work with OpenGL and Vulkan. I like to share what I know, what I have learned and solutions to challenges that I can overcome. This blog has been created in order not to keep my works on notes or personal computers only. For now only in my native language. Hopefully in the future it can be in English.

**Note:** this site theme was shamelessly forked from an awesome Jekyll theme [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/) by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/). I do not do any web development.
